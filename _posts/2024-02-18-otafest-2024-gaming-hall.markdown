This year, Endless ERA Gaming is thrilled to announce our continued partnership with Otafest, bringing an unparalleled gaming experience to the Otafest Gaming Hall from May 10 to May 12, 2024. As we take the helm of the gaming hall stage’s production and live stream, we're gearing up to make this Otafest not just memorable but historic, especially as we celebrate over Mother's Day long weekend.

### What’s New This Year?

- **Exclusive Otafest x ERA Merchandise:** In celebration of Otafest coinciding with Mother's Day weekend, we're excited to unveil our special edition Otafest x ERA T-shirt. This Mother's Day-themed design is the perfect way to commemorate your time at Otafest 2024, blending the spirit of gaming with a nod to the heroes in our lives – our mothers.

- **Engaging Stage Shows:** The stage will be buzzing with activity, featuring the highly anticipated return of ‘Gas, Gas, Gas,’ where participants will get a chance to race for the fastest time in a Trueno AE86 in Forza Horizon 4. Additionally, ‘Game That Tune’ makes a comeback with a technological twist, now allowing up to 200 users to buzz in from their phones, adding an extra layer of excitement and competition to the mix.

- **Meet Kenji, Our Otafest Gaming Arcade Character:** We're introducing Kenji, the newest member of our gaming family. Created using AI and 2D Live Studio, Kenji will be engaging with the audience, polling between shows, and keeping the energy high during breaks. Don’t miss your chance to interact with our AI-powered host, bringing a unique blend of technology and personality to the stage.

### Looking Forward to Otafest 2024

Endless ERA Gaming is honored to sponsor the Otafest Gaming Hall stage once again. We're committed to creating a vibrant, engaging, and technologically advanced gaming environment for all attendees. From exclusive merchandise and competitive gaming to interactive AI characters, Otafest 2024 is set to be an unforgettable celebration of gaming culture.
