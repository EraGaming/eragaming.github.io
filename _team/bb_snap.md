I've been gaming ever since I could remember. As a young girl, my parents took me to the arcade every weekend. I would stand in front of that X-Men cabinet, passing through levels like they were nothing. I'd have an audience of boys behind me, scratching their heads, thinking, "how is this 6-year-old girl, who needs a crate to reach the controls, dominating all our high scores?" From that moment on, gaming is all I ever wanted to do. I'm competitive, I rage, I have fun, but most importantly, I freaking GRIND! For me, it's not the destination; it's the journey. Bringing people together and making others smile is one of the most significant rewards anyone can achieve. And I love making that happen!
