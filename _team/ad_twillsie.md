They call me the Stream Doctor, but I am a developer, artist, musician, maker and a horrible gamer. I am the creative power house behind ERA, Extra Life YYC and Willsie Digital. If you're looking to up your streaming game, I am the guy you want to talk to. If you're looking to up your Apex game, I am the guy you want to avoid at all costs... Unless you find value in learning what not to do in a video game. Chill with me and you'll learn something new.
