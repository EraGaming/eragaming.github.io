I first started gaming when I discovered my cousin's NES, bypassing duck hunt and super Mario. My first ever game was Ninja Gaiden. For the next decade, I was obsessed with RPG's primarily the Final Fantasy Series. One day, I came across Call of Duty MW. It changed my gaming experience from single-player story mode to online gaming with new people every game. Meeting and connecting people became a passion as I continued to game online and meet new people every day. Fast forward another decade, Endless Era was born. Connecting amazing people like you to a fantastic community that grows every day has taken a stronghold in my life of gaming that I hope continues for another decade. For an Era.
