When I was a teen, I built my first computer out of leftover parts from an e-cycle bin to play a half-life mod called Counter-Strike. As time went on, I got really into CS, Quake, and other FPS games as multiplayer shooters were in their prime. Currently, I play all sorts of games with friends and the ERA community but still primarily play FPS games. Whether it's teamwork or adventuring, I love playing games that bring people together and hope to share these experiences with others.
