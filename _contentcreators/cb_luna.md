I'm a variety steamer based in Toronto who enjoys drawing, movies and food adventures! I enjoy streaming Dying Light, Left 4 Dead, Valorant, Monster Hunter, Animal Crossing, Art and Many more. I love playing games with viewers and getting to know everyone in the community. I started Streaming on August 21, 2018, and since then, I've met so many wonderful, funny and chill people who mean a lot to me. I was going through a rough time in my personal life, and streaming was a getaway to forget everything I had going on. Playing games, laughing till I cried and making friends worldwide made me such a happier person on and off streams. I can't thank those who were there for me enough because yall got me through a very dark time in my life.
