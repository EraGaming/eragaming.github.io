I've been gaming pretty much my entire life as my mom used to own an arcade when I was younger. Fast forward some 100 odd years later and I'm still here playing them. I also like some long boarding, food, and a few pints with my people. I've been around twitch since 2012, streaming a wide range of games (some competitive, but most PVE), and have seen a lot of things come and go. While it's not perfect I have met some amazing people around the platform. Here's to the people I've met and the people who I may meet in the future!
