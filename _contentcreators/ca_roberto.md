I’ve been gaming my entire life since I was around 8 years old! At the start of 2020 I decided to give streaming on twitch a go and was able to find amazing people and even better friends. One of my favorite things to do is to entertain and make people laugh. Now I’m able to do that through all these different social media platforms. You can find me on twitch fragging out in Apex or creating awesome tik tok content.
