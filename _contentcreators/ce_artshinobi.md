I am a gamer through and through, I have been for as long as I can remember. Going back to the old super Nintendo with my brother now to having my PC and building them myself. I've come to play almost every kind of game from retro to MMO to fps I love them all. Come to more present day and I've been creating and watching content since early 2015 and plan to keep. It is my goal to make a place where people feel safe and be themselves. I've found a community that embodies that goal and allows me to do the same no matter where life takes me.
