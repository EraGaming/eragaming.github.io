I'm a gamer dad who streams for the Jumpstart charity. My parents were boat people from Vietnam who got sponsored to Canada. They provided everything for us but couldn't afford the cost of organized sports â€” something I enjoy as an adult now. I stream and play Apex, COD and other games so that kids from low-income families can get to experience the same amount of joy I feel when I play sports. Let's play!
