After wanting to stream for numerous years, I finally began my journey in September 2021. My biggest goal in life is to make as many people feel happy and included, which is one of the main reasons why I started streaming. I am very competitive in whatever game I play, whether that be Valorant, Rocket League, or even Stardew Valley. I love trying new games and going through the journey with my viewers. I hope that by making myself look like a fool in front of a tiny little screen, that I can encourage others to be their fun, creative, and ambitious selves. If you want someone that's goofy, confused 98% of the time, that loves gaming, corgis, working out and is an absolute menace, I'm your girl.
